# Hello-World
Hence the Commencement!!

Hello..... world!!, here I am, not a complete novice but a fast learner with a growth mindset and passionate on aiding the world with programming. Coding is fun and python is awesome. I have been learning a few programming languages on SoloLearn, Udemy, and FreeCodeCamp, etc. It's fun to build logic with high-level languages like python. Bedsides, I am an amateur writer, who loves writing poems.
